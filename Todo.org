  - [ ] Make basic TODO app.
  - [ ] Make editing more like google keep.
  - [ ] On enter key, split text if cursor is in middle of text.
  - [ ] On backspace, if text still exists and caret is in
    [pos 0]. Merge text with previous item.
  - [ ] If at [pos 0] and left arrow, move to previous item at last
    position.
  - [ ] To simplify things, maybe pass in focusNext, focusPrev props
    in item. focusNext(START | END | DEFAULT). Move navigation code to
    list.
  - [ ] Change cursor behavior. Don't save position. Just move to the
    index of the previous item. Feels more natural.
