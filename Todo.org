Todo

* RESUME
  Get list switching to work. Each list should contain its own todo items.

* NOW
  - [ ] Make basic TODO app.
  - [ ] Hover state on <Switch>
  - [ ] On backspace, if text still exists and caret is in
    [pos 0]. Merge text with previous item.
  - [ ] Title field.
  - [ ] Remove InputField at some point and make last item
    undeletable.
  - [ ] Add workspaces/tags/organization/etc.
  - [ ] Rename todos/todo -> notes/note.
  - [ ] Remove redux-logger.
  - [ ] Rename TODO_ actions to use double underscore for namespacing TODO__
  - [ ] Rename components -> com
  - [::MIDDLEWARE::] Write middleware to automatically add .payload {} and meta {}
    to action if missing. Then refactor reducers to always assume a
    payload object.
  - [ ] Merge state/order and state/meta into state/todos.
  - [ ] Add multiple lists.
  - [ ] In reducers, use 'if' form instead of 'switch' statement.
  - [ ] In reducers, use 'if' form and in each if block declare the
    expected 'arguments' from 'payload'. See src/state/lists/lists.js
  - [ ] Rework 'createApi'. Because we have thunks we can assume a
    dispatch argument. We don't need to take a dispatch function
    because it's passed into every dispatch event. That means we also
    may not need to 'createApi' and can just use plain functions
    unattached to any instance.
  - [ ] In state submodules, use more consistent export default form:
    todos.actions, todos.reducer. export default {actions, reducer}
  - [ ] api.workspace.cycleNextList/cyclePrevList

* BRANCH: refactor/state
  - [ ] Remove state/order.

* UX
  - [ ] Handle SHIFT-UP.

  - [ ] GraphQL.
  - [ ] CSS Grid.
  - [ ] Django basics.

  - [ ] Add persisted data layer (todo items).
  - [ ] Basic styling (CSS grid based, visually grid based).
  - [ ] Add networking layer.
    - [ ] Persistence.
    - [ ] CRUD operations.
  - [ ] Add linting.
